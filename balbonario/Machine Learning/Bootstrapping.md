Bootstrapping is a technique to estimate the variability of a statistics from the empirical variability of that statistic between subsamples (extracted with replacement) of the empirical data, rather than from parametric assumptions.

Two assumptions have to hold true for bootstrapping to be useful:
- The size of the initial dataset should be large enough to capture most of the complexity of the underlying distribution so that sampling from the dataset is a good approximation of sampling from the real distribution.
- The size of the subsamples should be small compared to the size of the dataset so that samples are not too much correlated.
