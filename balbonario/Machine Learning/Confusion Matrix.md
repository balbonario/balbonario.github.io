A confusion matrix is a good but simple metric that should always be used when dealing with classification problems.
The matrix has on one axis the true label and on the other axis the predicted label. In each cell it is written the number of points with that true label and that predicted label.

From the confusion matrix multiple relevant quantities such as accuracy, precision and recall can be calculated.
Since simple accuracy can be misleading when one is analyzing a dataset with imbalanced classes, it is important to look at the whole matrix.
