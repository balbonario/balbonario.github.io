Cross-Validation refers to the practice of performing multiples independent splits of the dataset into a training set and a test set, and repeat the training of a new model and its evaluation on each independent split, to later average the results.

In a way this allows to use the $n$ initial datapoints multiple times and amounts to an estimation of the mean performance of the model under different initial samples.
This method can thus be used to compare the performance of different predictive modelling procedures.
