Overfitting occurs when the model is so specific to the data on which it has been trained that it is no longer applicable to other random samplings from the dataset, and thus has an almost zero train error but with a high test error.

Underfitting on the other hand happens when the model is too simple to accurately capture the relationships between its features $X$ and the label $Y$, and is manifested by having high train error and high test error.

These are generic terms to point out possible problems with models but there is no "measure of overfitting".
