Classical Machine Learning refers to the more ancient part of machine learning, which has many relations with statistics, and mainly deals with the problem of [[Function Approximation]] via [[Convex Optimization]] of some basic models.

## Theory
- [[Bias-Variance Decomposition]]
- [[Function Approximation]]
- [[Regularization]]
- [[The Curse of Dimensionality]]

## Classical Models
- [[K-Nearest Neighbours]]
- [[Linear Regression]]

## Practice
- Model ensembling methods: [[Bagging]], [[Boosting]], [[Stacking]].
- Model evaluation metrics: [[Confusion Matrix]], [[Cross-Validation]], [[ROC Curve]].

## Books
- [[Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman - The Elements of Statistical Learning]]
